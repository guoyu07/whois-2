WHOIS Lookup for PHP from MySQL Database

A simple PHP script that lets you look up several domain names WHOIS data. Uses several different companies to do a whois lookup. 

Note: GoDaddy makes it super difficult to lookup whois data from domains registered by them, and you can't scrape it because it requires a CAPTCHA on each lookup and after about 100 request they block your IP for 24 hours. Be aware of this.
